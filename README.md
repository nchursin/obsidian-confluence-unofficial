# Obsidian Confluence Unofficial

This is a plugin to publish pages from Obsidian to Confluence. It's Unofficial, in case you haven't noticed.

## Motivation
You might be asking "Why, God, why they keep making these plugins?!". The reasons behind this one are:

1. None of the existing plugins supported personal access token auth out of the box
1. They didn't work for our Confluence self-hosted instance
1. Our Confluence instance didn't work with HTML5 img tags

## Features
1. Basic or personal token auth
1. Create and update pages in Confluence

## Installation
This plugin isn't yet published to Obsidian plugin repository. The easiest way to install it is via [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

## How to use it
### In settings:
1. Setup Confluence URL
1. Setup Auth method
1. Setup default space
1. Setup default parent

### In file
1. Make changes
1. Run command `OCU: Publish File`
